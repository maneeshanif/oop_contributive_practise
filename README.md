/* OOp's 
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design and develop applications. Objects are instances of 
classes,which can contain both data (attributes or properties) and code (methods or functions). 
In other word's we say opp's is a collection of methods and properties.

here is breakdown of key concept of oop's:-

1) Class:
A blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have.

2) Object:
An instance of a class. It can have state (data) and behavior (methods).

3) Encapsulation:
Bundling the data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It also involves restricting direct access
 to some of the object's components, which is a way of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the data.

4) Inheritance:
A mechanism where a new class inherits the properties and behaviors (methods) of an existing class. This promotes code reusability and 
hierarchical classifications.

5) Polymorphism:
The ability to present the same interface for different underlying forms (data types). It allows methods to do different things based on 
the object it is acting upon, even if they share the same name.

6) Abstraction:
The concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. This simplifies the interaction
 with the object
